## NET 6.0 Minimal API 
Url: https://localhost:44381/ / http://localhost:44380/
 
## .NET Core 3.1
For deploy purposes. Hosted on https://somee.com/. I used free .Net Hosting which supports only ASP.Net 2.0-4.8, ASP.Net Core 3.1, therefore I created this API in the 3.1 .NET version. It is not the fastest host(it is free), but it is sufficient for a demo.<br>
